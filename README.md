# Health-Data-Visualization

This project aims to create data visualization using D3.js to give insights into US healthcare. Our json data file source is from "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD".

I created a bar chart to represent the data: x-axis represents the cause name and y-axis represents the number of cases.
