# Health-Data-Visualization

This project aims to create data visualization using D3.js to give insights into US healthcare. 

Our json data file source is from "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD".

I created a bar chart to represent the data on main health causes in the US: x-axis represents the cause name and y-axis represents the number of cases. The json data file data.json source is from "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bi63-dtpu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD".

I also created a line chart to represent the life expectancy of male and a scatterplot to represent the life expectancy in general in the US during the period 1955-2017. The json data file data2.json source is from "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/w9j2-ggv5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
